● Description
----------------------------
CMS based on PHP and Sqlite (or MySQL optional). Version 3.X is a major update with lots of changes. Upgrade from version 2.x is not recommended but doable.

● What is new
----------------------------
Major updates of version 3.0.0 released on Feb 23, 2021:
1. Major architectural change. The CMS engine is now totally separate from the main website. It is now easier to upgrade and deploy multiple websites with one central CMS folder location. Just create a symbolic link to the real CMS folder location.
2. Compatible with PHP 7
3. Upgraded to TinyMCE version 5.X: https://www.tiny.cloud/
4. Templates rewritten in CSS3 with flexbox etc
5. Builtin CAPTCHA module SECURIMAGE. https://github.com/dapphp/securimage/blob/master/securimage.php 
6. A simple image slideshow/carousal function in Javascript. To use it, in sidebar_one, either paste the following. Change your src location accordingly. Notice total number of the dot class tags should match the total pictures.

		<div id="slideshow">
		<div class="mySlides"><img src="media/myslide1.png"><div class="text">text1</div></div>
		<div class="mySlides"><img src="media/myslide2.png"><div class="text">text2</div></div>
		<div class="mySlides"><img src="media/myslide3.png"><div class="text">text3</div></div>
		<a class="prev" onclick="plusSlides(-1)">&#10094;</a>
		<a class="next" onclick="plusSlides(1)">&#10095;</a>
		</div>
		<div id="slideshow_dots">
		<span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(1)"></span>
		<span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(2)"></span>
		<span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(3)"></span>
		</div>
or use the built-in function:

[function:slideshow('"text1"::media/slide1.png||"text2"::media/slide2.png||"text3"::media/slide3.png)]

7. Other minor updates

----------------------------

 * or NGINX server (see below for installation guide)
 * PHP 7 with PDO and SQLite driver enabled

● INSTALLATION
----------------------------
 1. Load up the script files to your server
 2. Depending on your server configuration you may need to change the write
    permissions of the following subdirectories:
        * cms/cache (CHMOD 777) - cache directory, needs to be writable if
          you want to use the caching feature
        * media and images (CHMOD 777) - need to be writable if you want to
          use the file uploader
 3. Ready! You should now be able to access the index page by browsing to the
    address you uploaded RiteCMS (e.g.https://your-domain.tld/path/to/phpsqlitecms/). 
    To administrate the page, go to https://your-domain.tld/path/to/ritecms/cms/. 
    The default admin userdata is: username: admin, password: admin.
 4. special steps for nginx servers. You need to change your virtual host folder for redirect to work. Below is an example of server block.

		server {
			server_name ritecms.com;
			listen 80;
			root /var/www/public_html/ritecms.com; 
			index index.php index.htm index.html;
			error_log  /var/www/log/rite_error.log;
			access_log  /var/www/log/rite_access_error.log;
			location ~ \.m$ {if (!-e $request_filename){rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php?mobile=true&qs=$1 last;break;}}
			location / {if (!-e $request_filename){rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php?qs=$1 last;break;}} 
			location /data {deny all;return 404;}
			location ~ \.php$ {include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock;}
		}

No MySQL data initialization is provided. Please use the Sqlite version for reference located in the data folder.
5. to login to the backend, please use the new entry script at the root folder: admin.php. Default password is admin/admin.
  
● SECURITY
----------------------------
1. Please change your password asap.
